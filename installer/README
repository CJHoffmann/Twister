The installer must run with Python 2.7 and must run as ROOT.

If you are installing the Twister Server, it is strongly recommended to have
an internet connection, or else, you must manually install :
 - Python-DEV and
 - python-mysql.

The Twister Client doesn't have any required dependencies; pExpect is optional.

There are two steps :
 - Select what you wish to install (client or server)
 - Select the user you want to install for (if there's only 1 user, this step is skipped)

Twister will be installed in the home of the selected user, in folder `twister`.
This folder should not be renamed.

The installer will download and install any missing, or old dependencies.
If the requirements are met, all the files are copied, but nothing is installed.
