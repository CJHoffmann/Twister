The installer must run as ROOT, with Python 2.7.

If you are installing the Twister Server, you should be connected to internet,
or ELSE, before running the installer, you must manually install :
 - Python-DEV and
 - python-mysql.

The Twister Client doesn't have any required dependencies; pExpect is optional.

The installer will guide you through all the steps, in order.

There are two steps :
1 - Select what you wish to install (client or server)
2 - Select the user you want to install for (if there's only 1 user, this step is skipped)

Twister will be installed in the home of the selected user, in folder `twister`.
This folder should not be renamed.

Any dependencies that are missing, or very old versions, will be downloaded and installed.
If the requirements are met, all the files are copied, but nothing is installed.
