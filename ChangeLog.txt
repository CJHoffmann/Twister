30th July changes:

- implemented "stop on fail". If a test file fails, and the file is mandatory, and the "stop on fail"
  flag is activated, the execution process stops. The files that are optional must not stop the
  execution process if they fail. The "stop on fail" flag can be easily activated and deactivated.
- implemented "run temporary", a mechanism that allows 1 or more files to be run several times,
  without losing the stats from last run and without saving to database or sending e-mail report.
- better REST interface
- bug fixing.

  recorded in database ).
