
For OpenFlow tests, the Execution Process must be run with `sudo python start_ep.py`.

Prerequisites: you must have Openvswitch running, or a physical OpenFlow switch.
The configuration is made in file `of_config.py`.

To run the tests with Twister Framework, you must copy:
- `of_config.py`,
- `oflib/oflib.zip`,
- all Python files from `oflib` folder,
  into Central Engine lib folder, located at `/opt/twister/lib`.


Troubleshooting:

If following errors appears in the applet EP-*_CLI.log tab:

	NameError: name 'SimpleProtocol' is not defined
	Check if you copied all libraries into `/opt/twister/lib`.

	ImportError: No module named oftest.controller
	Check if you copied `oflib/oflib.zip` into `/opt/twister/lib`.

	If the tests are locked at lines :
	** START TEST CASE <__builtin__.Echo instance at 0xXXXXXXX>
	Connected None...
	Stop the tests and check if you started the Openvswitch and if it's configured correctly in `of_config.py`.
