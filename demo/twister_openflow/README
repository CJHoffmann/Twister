
For OpenFlow tests, the Execution Process must be run with `sudo python start_ep.py`.

To run the tests with Twister Framework, you must copy into Central Engine lib folder
  located at `/opt/twister/lib`:
- `of_config.py`,
- `oflib/oflib.zip`,
- all Python files from `oflib` folder.

Prerequisites: you must have OpenVswitch (openvswitch.org) running, OR a physical OpenFlow switch.

By default, in `of_config.py` the physical switch is configured for EP-1003,
  the rest (EP-1001 and EP-1002) are for virtual switch (OpenVswitch).



Troubleshooting:

If following errors appears in the applet EP-*_CLI.log tab:

	NameError: name 'SimpleProtocol' is not defined
	Check if you copied all libraries into `/opt/twister/lib`.

	ImportError: No module named oftest.controller
	Check if you copied `oflib/oflib.zip` into `/opt/twister/lib`.

	If the tests are locked at lines :
	** START TEST CASE <__builtin__.Echo instance at 0xXXXXXXX>
	Connected None...
	Stop the tests and check if you started the OpenVswitch OR if you have a physical switch,
	if it's configured correctly in `/opt/twister/lib/of_config.py`.
